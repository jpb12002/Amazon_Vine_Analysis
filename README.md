# Big Data

## Analysis Overview
The company $ellBy is about ot launch a lot of product on a large online retailer's website. They want to know how reviews of their products compare to similar competitor's products. $ellBy also intends to start a program to give incentive products to special, dedicated reviewers. However, they need to know if the extra cost is going to be justified before launching the service. To model the effectiveness of the program, we analyzed a video game review subset from the Amazon Vine Program to determine if there is bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members. 

## Results
### Video Game Review Summary
- Total Reviews
  - Vine: 94 reviews
  - Non-Vine: 40,471 reviews
- 5-Star Reviews
  - Vine: 48 reviews
  - Non-Vine: 15,663 reviews
- 5-Star Review Percentage
  - Vine: 51%
  - Non-Vine: 39%

## Summary
While there appears to be some positivity bias from Vine-reviewers, overall the data is heavily skewed toward non-Vine reviewers. Only 0.23% of the reviews in the dataset were from Vine reviewers. Therefore, we would need a much larger population of Vine reviewers to make any meaningful assumptions about positivity bias. 
- Additional analysis could include 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-Star Review Percentages for Vine versus non-Vine customers. This would allow us to inspect the overall spectrum of reviews for each type of customer to see if all reviews tend to be positively or negatively skewed.
